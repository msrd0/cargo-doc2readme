//! This is an example showcasing code blocks with hidden lines
//! 
//! Random lines with # will not be altered.
//! 
//! - The same goes for lines in lists starting with a sharp:
//! - # this line is not hidden
//! 
//! ```
//! // But in code blocks, lines starting with a # are hidden:
//! # // You can't see me
//! 
//! // But not when those lines are actually relevant:
//! #[no_std]
//! ```
