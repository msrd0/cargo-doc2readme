//! This is an example testing code blocks in lists
//!
//!   - in the past, this has caused issues
//!   - one of such cases was [#440](https://github.com/msrd0/cargo-doc2readme/issues/440)
//!   - therefore, we have this example/test:
//!     
//!     ```rust
//!     # #[derive(Clone, Copy)]
//!     struct Foo {
//!         bar: usize
//!     }
//!     ```
